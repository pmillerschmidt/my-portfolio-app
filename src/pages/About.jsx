                    <p> I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Mathpix.</p>
                    <p> I graduated from <strong>Yale University</strong> with a B.S. in <strong>Computer Science</strong> in 2023. I focused my studies on the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence and music.</strong> For my senior thesis, I built a <strong>harmonically-attentive LSTM melody generator.</strong> In 2022, I interned as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>Artiphon</strong>, a modern instrument startup. Alongside designing MIDI communication optimizations for their flagship product (Orba 2), I independently built a <strong>Markov-based melody generator in C++.</strong> In 2021, I worked at Gravitate AI, where I developed various <strong>AI/ML</strong> tools for customers, including an <strong>NLP matching algorithm</strong> to assign patients to providers.</p>
                    <p> At Yale, my chosen electives demonstrate my specific interests within computer science. For <strong><i>Software Engineering</i> (React, Vue, NodeJS, Firebase)</strong>, I worked with a team of engineers to build a portable web application that allows users to track their friends’ commutes home with a variety of safety features, including messaging and location services. In <strong><i>Computational Intelligence For Games</i> (Python)</strong>, I built <strong>AlphaBot</strong>, a minimax chess engine with Alpha-beta pruning and Scout optimizations. For <strong><i>Algorithmic Music</i> (Supercollider, MaxMSP)</strong>, I built numerous automated and responsive musical generation tools. In <strong><i>Natural Language Processing</i> (TensorFlow, Word2Vec, Keras)</strong>, I designed sequence-to-sequence text models using RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.</p>
                    <p> In addition to pursuing internships at startups, I have explored my interest in entrepreneurship by building organizations. In 2020, I co-founded <strong>Elite Suite Tutoring</strong>, a tutoring business dedicated to filling the educational gap left by virtual education during the pandemic. Additionally, I founded <strong>Grooveblocks</strong>, an edtech company with the goal of making music education more accessible and compelling. Grooveblocks takes a progressive, composition-based approach to music education and is grounded in physical, combinatory instruments. For Grooveblocks, I developed <strong>Teensy-driven hardware prototypes</strong>, a complementary <strong>Java-based Android application</strong>, and a formal pedagogy.</p>
                    <p> In my free time, I enjoy producing music, writing and performing comedy sketches, and skiing (this photo was taken when I worked as a lift attendant in Colorado). </p>
